# avatarpose

This project presents a way that involves a meaningful association between the NFT and the collector. It does this by allowing the collector to be a co-creator in the minting process.

The collector can participate by either:

- Using their real-time body motion to animate an avatar (/create page)
- or they can choose the poses for which they would like their animation to use. They do this by going to the /gallery page of the app
